# Introduction

This vignette documents the Schema Therapy Intake Shiny App, part of the 
"intakegui" R package. The app allows service-users to complete the latest 
versions of the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ), the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI), 
and the Schema Coping Inventory (SCI). Moreover, it automatically generates both 
CSV and PDF reports summarizing responses and scores, which allow the patient to
get an overview of the schema concepts and of their own scores before the session
with their therapist in which these concepts will be discussed.

# Features of the App

The application consists of four main tabs: Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ),
Schema Mode Inventory (SMI), Schema Coping Inventory, and Download Report. Users 
must complete all questions of the first questionnaire before accessing the 
following one, and all questionnaires must be fully completed before downloading 
a report. The UI is built using "shinydashboard" and enhanced with "shinyjs" for 
interactivity.

# How the App Works

The app is a standard **Shiny application**, composed of a `ui` and `server` component.

```{r eval=FALSE}
shiny::runApp(system.file("shiny-app", package = "intakegui"))
